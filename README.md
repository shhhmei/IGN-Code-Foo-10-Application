# IGN-Code-Foo-10-Application
Hello IGN Team! 

I'm Josh Mei, a current undergraduate second year at Columbia University. Thank you so much for this opportunity to apply for an internship with your team! I had a genuine blast learning a lot of the concepts I had to apply, including (but not limited to) SQL, Spring Boot, JDBC, and Electromagnetic Physics!

In this repository, you'll find the entirety of my application.
